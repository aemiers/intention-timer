# Intention-Timer

Intention-timer is a program that allows a user to time and keep track of productive tasks. The user is able to select a category of task, give a written description of their task, set how many minutes and seconds they would like to spend doing the task, and finally allows the user to log the completed activity. 

## Launch

## Functionality
On the home page the user is given the choice of three activity buttons: Study, Meditate, and Exercise. Once one button is selected the coloring of the button changes to a color unique to that activity. If the user decides they want to select a different activity button the colors of the buttons will change according to which is selected.

After selecting a category button the user can then fill out all the inputs for their activity: activity description, minutes, and seconds duration. If the user misses an input or attempts to proceed to the next screen without completing all input fields, then an error will appear prompting the user to fill out the entire form.

When all the input fields are filled out and an activity button is selected then the user can proceed to the next page where they will find a timer with the minutes and seconds they input on the previous page. If any number less than 10 was input into the minutes and seconds field then the timer will automatically add a zero before the number so that the timer stays unified. The user's task description appears at the top of the page and a large start button is visible. When the user is ready to begin their timed task they must click the start button and the timer will start counting down.

After the time runs out a 'COMPLETE' message will appear and the user is given the option to log the completed activity to the 'Past Activities' card holder on the right side of the screen. A colored bar will display on the logged activity card; this color matches the category button color the user selected on the home page.

If the user decides to add the completed activity to the logged activities they will be brought to a new page where Carlton dances and congratulates them on their logged activity. At the top of the page the user is given the option to create a new activity and is then brought to the home page to fill out the form again.

Once the user is back at the home page their completed activities will appear on the right side of the screen. They can continue to fill out the form, complete, and log as many activities as they desire. If the user logs more activities than their screen will display then the user will notice a scrolling functionality only on the 'Past Activities' section. This allows the user to scroll and view all of their previously logged activities/tasks.
